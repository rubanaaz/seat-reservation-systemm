# seat-reservation-systemm

As a member of the team, in this project, I created the PowerPoint presentation that summarizes the seat reservation system. My work focused on translating the core concepts and functionalities of the system into a clear, engaging, and informative presentation. I worked on visually representing the system’s process, key features, and programming concepts such as modular programming, array manipulation, and input validation. Additionally, I ensured that the presentation highlighted the improvements and future scope of the project, such as adding a GUI and multi-user support. I also made sure to present the flowchart and the key contributions effectively, making it easy for the audience to understand the system’s functionality. My contribution also included organizing the content in a structured manner and ensuring that it was concise, visually appealing, and aligned with the project’s objectives.
